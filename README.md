## Introduction
This is a Lovelace card for Home Assistant that can be used to create a time schedule for your smart devices.
You can create new rules, modify existing rules and temporarily disable rules.

The card works on top of the [scheduler custom component](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component). You *will* need it this as well.

See it in action:

## Installation
<details>
<summary>click to show installation instructions </summary>

HACS installation:
##### Note: Ensure you have a www folder created as in config/www or the installation will succeed but fails silently
1. Click the Orange + button bottom right and search for Scheduler Card
2. Click on "Install" under the new card that just popped up.
3. Use the GUI; Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources Tab to add `/hacsfiles/scheduler-card/scheduler-card.js`, or add a reference to the card in the resources section of `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /hacsfiles/scheduler-card/scheduler-card.js
    type: module
```

##### Note: Ensure to install [`https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component`](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component) and add the integration in order for the scheduler to work properly.


Manual installation

1. Download the latest release of `scheduler-card.js` [here](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-card/releases) and place it into `www/scheduler-card`.

2. Use the GUI; Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources Tab to add `/local/scheduler-card/scheduler-card.js?v=0`, or add a reference to the card in the resources section of `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/scheduler-card/scheduler-card.js?v=0
    type: module
```

 3. Add the card in the view where you want it to be shown:

  ```yaml
 type: custom:scheduler-card
 domains:
   ...
 entities:
   ...
 groups:
   ...
  ```

</details>

## Updating

<details>
<summary>click to show updating instructions </summary>

Updating via HACS:
HACS should auto-remind you in the HACS tab when an update is available.

Updating manually:

Use `git pull` for manual installation updates.

Since most browsers will cache the Lovelace card code, you can force a refresh of  the browser by editing the entry in the `resources:` section in  `ui-lovelace.yaml`, by updating the version to `?v=(n+1)` (where `n` the current value).

## Usage

### Creating a schedule
Click the button 'add item' in the bottom of the card, to start creating a schedule.

#### Choosing an entity and action
The card scans the entities in your HA configuration and suitable candidates should automatically show up in this view.

__Groups__
Since HA may contain many entities, the card divides the entities into different groups.
Clicking a group automatically will show the entities contained in the group.

The groups that are displayed are depending on your HA configuration.
Typically the groups are based on the _domain_ of your entities.
If you want to make changes to the groups, you can do this by defining [groups](#groups) configuration.

__Entities__
The entities that you can to control with the scheduler show up here.
Clicking a entity automatically will show the actions that you can program for this entity.

Typically an entity is a device in your house, but you can also control an `automation`, `script`, `input_boolean`, etc. You can add all entities that you want to control in the [include](#include) list.

__Actions__
The actions that you can perform for the selected entity show up here.
 Typically an action is to either 'turn on' or 'turn off' a device. But some entities have more capabilities. If you are missing an action, you can add it yourself using the [customize](#customization) configuration.


 Actions can contain a variable setting (e.g. turn on a lamp at specific brightness, or change the setpoint for a thermostat).
These can be defined in the next page.

#### Choosing the days
After clicking the 'next' button, a new view appears.
This view is used for choosing _when_ the schedule should be active.

Choose the days of the week for which the schedule should be active.


__Every day__
 the default option. The schedule will perform the action every day at the specified time.

__Workdays__
perform action only on Monday thru Friday. 
If you have the [workday integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/workday/) installed, you can use it to define your own set of workdays.
The workday integration and its settings will be automatically detected if it is installed.
Note that if you define holDays, they will be excluded from workdays.

__Weekend__
perform action only on Saturday and Sunday. 
If you have the workday integration installed, the weekend will be considered as the inverse as workdays. This means that holDays and your 'fixed day off' are included in the weekend setting.


__Custom__
choose your own days. A list with all days of the week appears. You can select one or more days by clicking them.


#### Choosing the time

The time at which you want schedule to be activated can be set using the time picker.



The time picker shows the current time setting, and features arrow buttons to increase or decrease the hour and minutes. Note that you can infinitely loop through time.
The step size for minutes is 10 minutes by default, but can be configured to your preference.

If you have the AM/PM option enabled, 12-hour format will be used. You can click on the button to switch between AM and PM.

__Sunrise / sunset mode__

If you have the [sun](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sun/) integration in HA, a button with sun/moon icon shows up on the right. This is the _mode button_, which allows you to switch from a fixed time, to time relative to sunrise or sunset.  
The card allows you to choose a time that is 2 hours around sunrise or sunset. The button will be disabled if the current time is not in this range.

In sunrise/sunset mode, the time picker will show the offset relative to sunrise/sunset. The time offset is automatically calculated from fixed time.
The _sunrise/sunrise button_ will show a sun icon when offset is relative to sunrise, or a moon icon when offset is relative sunset.
The _before/after button_ indicates whether the offset is applied in positive direction (so triggers after sunrise/sunset), or in negative direction (before sunrise/sunset).
Also here, buttons can be clicked to toggle.

:warning: **Important**: _What you see is what you get_ here. If you want to store time as relative to sunrise or sunset, make sure that you have this _mode_ activated when you click the save button.

### Creating a time scheme

A time scheme is a more advanced type of schedule, which allows multiple actions during the day through the use of timeslots.

#### Timeslots
A timeslot defines a time range during which you want an entity to be in a certain state.
Every timeslot has a start time and end time, together with an action.

An action defined for a timeslot will *normally* be executed when the time reaches the starting time of the slot. 
So in this sense the behaviour is not different compared to a a normal schedule.

But there are differences:
* If you create (or edit) a new time scheme: the schedule will determine which timeslot is active, and trigger this action immediately.
* If you enable a disabled time scheme: the schedule will determine which timeslot is active, and trigger this action immediately.
* If HA is restarted: the schedule will determine which timeslot is active, and trigger this action immediately.
* If the entity (used in the action) is *unavailable* when the action needs to be triggered: the schedule will wait for this entity to become *available* (anything other than *unavailable*), and then trigger the action. Of course only while the timeslot is active.

After a timeslot has triggered the action, the schedule will wait for the next timeslot.
So, you can keep controlling your entity as you want without worrying that the schedule will not re-trigger its action again.

:warning: **Note** At the end of the timeslot, there is no action executed.
This means that if you turn on a device during a timeslot, you will have to add a second timeslot to turn it off.
It is *highly recommended* (but not required) to assign actions to every timeslot, such that the behaviour for the whole day is defined.

#### Time scheme editor

The time scheme editor allows you to configure the timeslots of your schedule and visualizes the result.

A time scheme starts at 00:00 and ends at 23:59, so it covers a full day. Depending on the selected days, the schedule continues with the first slot of next day after the last one ended. So usually the first and last slot should have the same action.

__Draggable markers__
The card shows a bar with multiple time markers which you can drag/slide to change the duration of the timeslots.
The time step is currently limited to 15 mins intervals.

__Selectable timeslots__
By clicking on a timeslot, it becomes selected and will have highlighted color.
When a timeslot is selected, you can assign an action to it.

__Divide or merging of timeslots__
When a timeslot is selected, you can click the '+' or '-' buttons to either divide (split in two) or merge (combine with the next slot)) the selected timeslot.

:warning: **Note** Due to the limited width of the Lovelace cards in HA, it might be difficult to make a short timeslot. 
Since there is not really a way to fix this, it's recommended to use a PC or use your phone on landscape mode when creating a time scheme.

### Options panel
The options panel gives you access to additional settings that you can set up for schedules.

The options panel is called the way it is, because all settings here are *optional*. So it is OK to ignore it if you don't miss any of its functions.

#### Condition editor

The condition editor allows you to define a set of rules which need to pass before the action may be executed.
Conditions are currently limited to checking the state of (other) HA entities (so not their attributes). States may be numeric, on/off or string type. Date/time format is not supported.

The editor allows you to make rules in various ways: logic *AND*, *OR*, *NOT* functions, as well as *below* and *above* for numeric states.
You can combine multiple entities if needed.

All entities having `states` configured will show up in the editor.
For more information on this, see [conditions](#conditions).

:warning: **Note**: Conditions are only evaluated at the time the actions should fire. This means that if the conditions are not met, the timer event will be skipped. It will not be re-evaluated when any of the entities involved in the conditions change.

#### Name

By default, all schedules will have an automatically generated entity ID and friendly name.
This means they could be hard to find back in the entity registry.

By defining your own friendly name, this will assigned to the entity, and the entity ID of the entity will be based on this name as well.
If you leave the field empty, the automatically generated name shall be used instead.

#### Behaviour after triggering

The *behaviour after triggering* option does exactly what it says.
You can choose what to do after the schedule is triggered:
* Repeat (default option): the schedule will reset the timer for next execution after it is triggered
* Single: the schedule will remove itself after it has been triggered once
* Pause: the schedule will disable itself after it has been triggered once, it can be reset by turning it back on

## Configuration


### Introduction
The configuration of the card is in YAML.
Currently there is no UI editor provided (this may change in the future).

_Configuration is not necessary_, it is only used for customization.

The card includes a _standard configuration_.
It is intended to make setting up the card easy.
The standard configuration consists of the following:
* Discovery of devices (entities) of various types in your HA config and making them available for creating schedules
* Defining actions per entity based on their capabilities
* Icons for groups, entities and actions

:warning: **Tip**: If you want to define your own configuration, provide `standard_configuration:false` to disable it completely.

### Standard configuration

The card includes a _standard configuration_.
It is intended to make setting up the card easy.
The standard configuration has actions defined for most types of entities in Home assistant.

When including an entity, the standard configuration will automatically detect which actions are supported by it, and will make these available.

Also it has icons for most entity types and actions.

If you would rather set up your own configuration of entities and actions, you can provide `standard_configuration:false` to disable it.


:warning: **Note**: Not all entity types are currently supported by the standard configuration. If you are missing something, you can make a [feature request](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-card/issues/new) for it.

### Adding entities

#### Include

The `include` configuration allows you to pick entities from your HA config that you can use for creating schedules.

You can either provide the full `entity_id` of the entities, or only the domain.

The list supports wildcards (*) as well. It is recommended to use quotes ("") around your input, else it may be wrongly interpreted.

<u>Example:</u>

```yaml
include:
  - climate.my_thermostat # include an individual entity
  - light # include all light entities
  - "*garden*" # include all entities containing the word 'garden'
  ...
```
#### Exclude

The `exclude` configuration allows you to remove entities from your HA config from appearing in the scheduler.

The `exclude` list works on top of the `include` list, so it behaves like *'ADD (includes) EXCEPT (excludes)'*.

Like with `include`, you can either provide the full `entity_id` of the entities, or the domain, or use wildcards.


```yaml
include:
  - light # include all light entities
exclude:
  - light.my_light_that_i_never_use # exclude
```


### Groups
The `groups` configuration provides the capability of organizing the entities.
To be clear, they have nothing to do with the [group](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/) integration in Home Assistant.

By default, entities will be grouped based on their type (domain). 
Entities that are assigned to your own defined group will not be grouped by type.

| Name    | Type   | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name    | string | (same as group_id) | Displayed name for group                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Schedule discovery

The card checks for the created schedules in your HA config and show them in the overview page.

The schedule discovery is a feature that will ensure that **all** your schedules will be there.

What is the benefit of this feature?

It could occur that you make changes in the configuration, resulting in previously created schedules to become hidden.
For example, you made a schedule for controlling a `fan`.
The day after you decide to remove the `fan` domain from the card. But you forgot to delete the previously created schedule.

Without the discovery, you now have a schedule that is hidden from the card, but will keep running. You cannot remove or change it anymore (unless via the HA configuration panel).

Discovery makes sure that you will always find it back in the card.
The feature can be turned on/off through the `discover_existing` option.

For your protection, it is enabled by default.

:warning: **Tip**: You should set `discover_existing:false` if you want to use multiple cards. Else you will see each created schedule in every card.


### Customize
With the `customize` configuration you can specify configuration for specific HA entities.

:warning: **Tip**: You can use entities `configuration` in combination with the standard configuration. The configurations will be merged.

#### Actions
An action defines **what** needs to be done when a schedule timer expires.

An action is similar to a [service call](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/service-calls/) in HA. It requires a `service` with optionally additional parameters given by `service_data`.

Actions are linked to their entities, so the entity ID is sent together with the service call, it is not needed to add it to the `service_data`).

| Name         | Type   | Default           | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| service      | string | **Required**      | Service to be executed                                  |
| service_data | map    | none              | Additional parameters to use for the service call       |
| variable     | map    | none              | Add a variable. See [action variable](#action-variable) |
| name         | string | (same as service) | Displayed name for action                               |
| icon         | string | "flash"           | Displayed icon for action                               |

:warning: **Note**: Templates (jinja code) are not supported at this point.

<u>Example:</u>

*Adding an action to turn on a light with 40% brightness*
  ```yaml
customize:
    light.my_lamp:
      name: "Dining light"
      icon: ceiling-light
      actions:
        - service: turn_on
          service_data:
            brightness: 100 # note that brightness is from 0-255 so 100 = 40%
          name: "Turn on at 40%"
          icon: lightbulb-on-outline
  ```
Result:

![customize example](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-card/blob/main/screenshots/entities_example.png?raw=true)


**Customizing actions from standard configuration**

How actions in customize are processed:
* If the action matches with a previously defined action, your action will replace the default action.
* If the action does not match with an existing action, the card will create a new action.

Actions are compared based on matching `service` and `service_data` (note that variables are not considered).


:warning: **Note**: If a match is found, your action will *replace* (and not *modify*) the default action.<br>This means that you are expected to (re-)define name, icon, and variable configuration.

#### Numeric action variable

Some devices allow to operate on a variable working point. For example lights can be dimmed with a `brightness`, fans can spin at a `speed` etc.

By providing an action variable, the card allows you to choose the setting you want to apply with the action.

| Name     | Type    | Default       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field    | string  | **Required**  | field name in the `service_data` that is represented by this variable                                                                                                                                 |
| name     | string  | same as field | Name under which the variable is visible in the card                                                                                                                                                  |
| unit     | string  | " "           | Displayed unit                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| min      | number  | 0             | Minimum value that can be set. If not provided, it will be read from the entity attributes.                                                                                                           |
| max      | number  | 255           | Maximum value that can be set. If not provided, it will be read from the entity attributes.                                                                                                           |
| step     | number  | 1             | Step size                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| optional | boolean | false         | Setting the variable is optional, the action can also be executed without this variable. <br>If `optional:true` is provided, a checkbox will be shown that needs to be selected to apply the variable |

**Example**

The Xiaomi Air Purifier can be controlled using the [Xiaomi Miio](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_miio/#service-xiaomi_miiofan_set_favorite_level-air-purifiers-only) integration.
To be able to set the speed of this device in your action, you can use:
```yaml
customize:
  fan.xiaomi_purifier:
    actions:
      - service: xiaomi_miio.fan_set_favorite_level
        name: "set speed"
        variable:
          field: level
          name: "Speed"
          min: 1
          max: 16
```
You can now select the speed for this action in the schedule editor:

![action variable example](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-card/blob/main/screenshots/action_variable_example.png?raw=true)

#### List action variable

With some actions, you can provide an option from a limited list of options.
For example, setting the value of an `input_select`, but also the operation mode of a thermostat.

By providing the list variable, the card allows you to choose the option when you set up the action.

| Name                          | Type   | Default       | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field                         | string | **Required**  | field name in the `service_data` that is represented by this variable         |
| name                          | string | same as field | Name under which the variable is visible in the card                          |
| options                       | list   | **Required**  | List of options to choose from                                                |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value | string | **Required**  | Option value (which is passed with together with the field as `service_data`) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name  | string | same as value | Name to show for the option                                                   |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;icon  | string | none          | Icon to show with the option                                                  |

**Example**

Setting the operation mode of a thermostat.

Note that this configuration will already be set up when using _standard configuration_.

```yaml
customize:
  climate.my_thermostat:
    name: My thermostat
    icon: thermometer
    actions:
      - service: set_hvac_mode
        name: Set mode
        icon:
        variable:
          field: hvac_mode
          name: Operation mode
          options:
            - value: heat
              icon: fire
            - value: cool
              icon: snowflake
            - value: 'off'
              icon: power
```
Now the list of options become visible when you set up the action:

![action variable example](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-card/blob/main/screenshots/action_variable_list_example.png?raw=true)


#### Conditions

If you want to use a specific entity as a condition in a schedule, this can be configured by defining it in `customize` as well.

To do so, you will need to tell the card which states the entity can have, which is done using the `states` parameter.

There are two options for this:
1. Define a list of possible states
2. Define a numeric range for the state

If an entity has its states defined, it will automatically show up when creating a condition.

Example of defining a state list:
```yaml
customize:
  input_boolean.my_condition_entity:
    states: ['on','off']
```

Example of defining a numeric range:
```yaml
customize:
  sensor.my_other_condition_entity:
    states: {min: 0, max: 100, step: 1, unit: '%'}
```


### Display options
From v1.9.0, it is possible to configure what is displayed in the overview list.
By default, the card will display the entity + action on the first line, and on the second line the remaining time until the schedule will be triggered. For timeslots, there will be a display of the extra actions.

:warning: **Note**: This is a YAML-only feature currently, Not available in the UI editor.

Supported options for `display_options`:
| Name             | Type           | Default                                          | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary_info`   | string or list | `- "{entity}: {action}"`<br>`- additional-tasks` | Displayed text on the first line.<br>Choose from the properties below. |
| `secondary_info` | string or list | `relative-time`                                  | Displayed text on the second line<br>Choose from the properties below. |
| `icon`           | string         | "action"                                         | Choose which icon is displayed (`action` or `entity`)                   |

For creating multiple lines, enter a list of multiple properties. Empty items will be automatically skipped.

For combining multiple properties in a single line, use wildcards (with property in brackets). Make sure to wrap your text in quotes.

:warning: **Pro-tip**: You can use HTML for formatting the lines. So for example: `<b>{entity}</b>` will print the name in bold text.


The following properties are available:
| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | Friendly name of the schedule (as configured in the 'options' panel)<br>Only if a custom name is defined (the generated ID will not be displayed). |
| `entity`           | Friendly name of the entity which is involved in the action.                                                                                       |

| `relative-time`    | Duration until the schedule is triggered (if the schedule is enabled).<sup>1</sup>                                                                 |
| `time`             | Configured time for the schedule.<sup>1</sup>                                                                                                      |
| `days`             | Configured days for the schedule.                                                                                                                  |
| `additional-tasks` | The amount of remaining tasks/actions (other than the displayed one).<br>Only for time schemes, otherwise this property is skipped.                |

<sup>1</sup> For *time schemes*, the displayed value corresponds to the closest timeslot.

The _scheduler-card_ checks the capabilities of your climate devices and shows appropriate actions for it.

If your climate device features multiple [hvac_modes](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/climate/#hvac-modes), the scheduler will automatically switch your climate device to the correct mode in the built-in actions.

The following actions are implemented:

 | Predefined action name <sup>1</sup> | Available when                                                                               | Behaviour of scheduler                                                                                       |
 | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
 | "Heat"                              | entity supports `hvac_mode: heat`                                                            | execute service `set_temperature` <br> with `hvac_mode: heat` <br> and `temperature` to the value you choose |
 | "Cool"                              | entity supports `hvac_mode: cool`                                                            | execute service `set_temperature` <br> with `hvac_mode: cool` <br> and `temperature` to the value you choose |
 | "Set temperature"                   | entity does not support `hvac_mode: heat` <br> and entity does not support `hvac_mode: cool` | execute service `set_temperature` <br> with `temperature` to the value you choose                            |
 | "Turn Off"                          | entity supports `hvac_mode: off`                                                             | execute service `set_hvac_mode` with `hvac_mode: off`                                                        |
 | "Turn Off"                          | entity does not support `hvac_mode: off`                                                     | execute service `turn_off`                                                                                   |

<sup>1</sup> These are the English names, depending on your language they may be translated in your card.

In case your device does not work well with actions 'heat' or 'cool', this indicates that there is a bug in the integration (which I cannot fix for you).
Most probably the implementation of service [climate.set_temperature](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/climate/#service-climateset_temperature) does not check for the `hvac_mode` property.

As a workaround, you can add the 'legacy' set temperature action to the card and see if it helps:

```yaml
customize:
  climate: # replace with climate.my_entity if you want to target a specific device
    actions:
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        name: "Set temperature"
        icon: fire
        variable:
          field: temperature
          name: "Temperature"
          min: 10
          max: 30
          step: 0.5
    exclude_actions: # hide the built-in actions
      - "heat" # use your local translation of this action name
      - "cool" # use your local translation of this action name
```


### *Can I make a schedule that checks a condition before executing the action?*

From within the _scheduler-card_, there is unfortunately no such functionality in place.
There are two alternative ways:

__1. Use an `automation` to control when the schedule is running__

 Create an `automation` that checks for the condition, and based on this, enables or disables the schedule.
 Run service `switch.turn_off` or `switch.turn_on` with the entity_id matching your schedule.

<u>Main disadvantage</u>: the entity_id of a schedule is not easy to read: they are randomly generated, and the entity_id does not tell anything about the related entity.


__2. Use an `script` to check the condition before execution of the action__

 Create a `script` that checks for the condition, and if it passes, executes the action.
 Use the scheduler to execute this `script` (instead of the actual entity you want to control).
Currently this is considered the best option.

<u>Main disadvantage</u>: you will have to add configuration to the card to make the `script` selectable in the scheduler-card. The result will look less pretty than with other entities.

<br>

Example: _Turn on my thermostat at X degrees. but only if my window is closed_

Create the `script` (for setting up scripts see [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/)):
```yaml
my_script:
  fields:
    temperature: {} # allow temperature as variable field
  sequence: # sequence for multiple steps, aborts if a step fails
    - condition: state # check the condition
      entity_id: binary_sensor.my_window
      state: 'off'
    - service: climate.set_temperature # update the temperature
      data_template:
        entity_id: climate.my_thermostat
        temperature: "{{ temperature }}"

```
To add the newly created script to HA you need to restart HA (or run 'reload scripts').

Now make sure to `include` it in the scheduler-card and you should be able to schedule a *run* action for it.

### *How do I check which version I am using?*

In your browser, open the console log. This is usually accessible from the developer tools (MS Edge: F12, Chrome: ctrl+shift+i). There should be a badge titled _"SCHEDULER-CARD"_ with the version number included.

<br>

### *How do I fix error 'Failed to call service scheduler/add. Service not found.' ?*

This error suggests that the [scheduler-component](https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component) is not running. Please do NOT file an issue in this repo.

<br>

### *Why is there no such scheduler in HA yet?*

Good question, ask the developers!

But let's see if we can get convince them to adopt this scheduler, simply by making it awesome :)
